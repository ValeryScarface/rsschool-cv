Hi! I'm just a regular everyday normal guy who wants to learn something new and cool. I think my best side is **energy**, i got lots of it and it's gonna be a huge support to reach the goal. 
I'm new to the _programming stuff_ so unfourtunatly there're no any skills i could've show off to you right now. Well, that's only for now. Give me some time.
My english isn't as great as i wanted it to be but still i try to make it better everyday. I'm pretty sure it's _intermediate_ or something. 
The only practice i have is watching movies in english, listening to english music and so on. That's sad because i'd love to talk to native speakers. Would be way more useful to impove the skill.

I guess that's it, see ya!
